# Hi there I'm Sean! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m an incoming SDE intern at Amazon this summer. Iâ€™m also a second year undergrad at UCSD studying Computer Science. I enjoy hacking away at web dev projects and tinkering with my Arch Linux machine.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on anything I find interesting, which is a lot of web apps with JavaScript stacks.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot me an [email](mailto:seanye24@gmail.com) or send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seancye/)!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like building custom mechanical keyboards (currently rocking 62g Alpacas with 205g0).
