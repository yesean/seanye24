# Hi there I'm Sean! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a third year undergrad at UCSD studying Computer Science. I enjoy hacking away at [random projects](https://github.com/seanye24?tab=repositories) as well as [tinkering](https://github.com/seanye24/dotfiles) with cool software like [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Shoot me an [email](mailto:seanye24@gmail.com) or send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/seancye/)!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like building custom keyboards (currently rocking 62g Alpacas with 205g0!).
