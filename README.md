# Hi there I'm Sean! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a third year undergrad at UCSD studying Computer Science. I enjoy hacking away at [random projects](https://github.com/seanye24?tab=repositories) and [tinkering](https://github.com/seanye24/dotfiles) around with fun software like [Arch](https://archlinux.org/) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).
